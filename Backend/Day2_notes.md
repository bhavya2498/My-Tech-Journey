# Backend Day 2 Notes

## How the Internet Works (Summary)
- The internet is a network of connected computers.
- A client sends a request, a server sends a response.
- ISPs route the request across the internet.

## Internet Protocols
- IP = addressing system for computers.
- Every device has an IP address.
- IPv4 (older), IPv6 (newer).
- Helps route packets from client → server.

## HTTP (from today)
- HTTP is the communication protocol of the web.
- Browser sends HTTP requests (GET/POST).
- Servers respond with status codes (200, 404, 500).
